The final echo of battle fades into silence.

The dungeon, once crawling with monsters and fear, now lies still.
Broken weapons litter the ground, and the air feels lighter… calmer.

You stand alone, breathing heavily, your body scarred but unbroken.
Every corridor you walked, every enemy you faced — none were in vain.

The creatures that terrorized these halls are gone.
Their reign ends here.

You were sent as a hero.
You leave as a legend.

As light pours in from the dungeon entrance, you take one final look back —
and walk forward, victorious.
