Your strength fades.
Your weapon slips from your grasp and strikes the stone floor.

The dungeon does not pause.
It never does.

The monsters watch as your vision blurs,
their shadows stretching across the cold walls.

You fought bravely.
But bravery alone was not enough.

As darkness closes in, the echoes of the dungeon swallow your final breath.
Another hero lost.
Another warning left unheard.

The monsters remain.
And the dungeon waits… for the next soul to enter.
