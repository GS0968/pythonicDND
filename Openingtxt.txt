The dream ends the same way every time.
Fire. Screams. And a voice that does not allow refusal.
"Rise."
Your eyes open.
Before you stands the fortress - ancient, cursed, and festering with monsters that should not exist. For years, its halls have poisoned the land, sending creatures crawling into nearby villages under cover of night.

Kings have sent armies.
None returned.
So they sent you.
Not because you are fearless - but because you are capable.

Your mission is simple, even if survival is not:
Enter the fortress.
Cleanse every hall.
Leave nothing alive.

The massive doors of the stronghold groan open as you step forward, sealing shut behind you with a final, echoing thud.
No turning back.
The Entrance Hall stretches before you - wide, cold, and eerily quiet. Tall pillars rise toward a ceiling lost in shadow, and torches flicker weakly along the walls, as if afraid of what lurks beyond.

Your hand rests on your weapon.
This is where every hero begins.
A sudden scrape breaks the silence.
From behind a fallen pillar, a hunched figure crawls into view - green-skinned, sharp-eyed, clutching a rusted blade.
A Goblin.
One of the fortress's weakest creatures... yet still deadly to the unprepared.
It hisses when it sees you.
"Hero... same as the others."
You steady your breathing.
Beyond this hall lies the Hall of Fame, and from there, the deeper chambers of the fortress - each crawling with stronger, smarter horrors.
This is your trial.
And it begins now.
