As you breathe out, the Goblin chuckles.

“You heros don't know when to stop don't you? You guys will never defeat us.” 

This is your first battle.

In combat, you have two ways to fight:

Basic Attacks —
Reliable strikes that use your raw strength or skill.
They are safe, consistent, and can be used every turn.

Special Attacks —
Powerful techniques unique to your class.
They deal greater damage, but require focus and cannot be used endlessly.

Choose wisely.
A reckless blow may leave you exposed,
but hesitation may cost you your life.

The Goblin lunges forward.
Your battle begins now.
